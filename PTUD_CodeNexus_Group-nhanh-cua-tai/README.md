Welcome to Our Web Development Team!

We are a group of six passionate students from the Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City (IUH), working together as part of our application development course. Our current project is a website dedicated to renting books, newspapers, and comics. Each team member brings unique skills—from front-end design and coding to back-end development and database management—allowing us to create a dynamic and user-friendly platform. We are excited to grow as developers and contribute to both the tech and reading communities through this project.
